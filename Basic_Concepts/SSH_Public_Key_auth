SSH public key authentication is a method of logging into an SSH/SFTP account using a cryptographic key rather than a password.
Keys come in pairs of a public key and a private key. Each key pair is unique, and the two keys work together.

These two keys have a special mathematical relationship: if your server is configured with your public key, you can prove you have the corresponding private key without sharing the private key.

Public key authentication works like this:

1. Generate a key pair (public and private key).
2. Put the public key on the server.
3. When you SSH into the server, your SSH client proves to the server that you have the corresponding private key.
